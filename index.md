<H2>Part 1: Shelby Houlihan and Burrito-Gate</H2>

<U><B>Introduction</B></U><BR>
<BR>
On June 14, 2021, Shelby Houlihan, a U.S. Olympian and American record holder on the track at 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters announced that she received a 4-year ban
from the sport of Track & Field (Athletics) due to a positive drug test for the anabolic steroid, nandrolone. Inaccurate information about the case spread around the 
Internet in the form of articles, videos and tweets. Part 1 of this article was written to clear up misconceptions about this case. Before diving into the details of this case, 
readers should note that I do not know Shelby Houlihan or anyone associated with her or with her sponsors.<BR>
<BR>
Parts of this article contains scientific information. To make this article easier to understand, I will gradually introduce terms and concepts. In order to whet your 
appetite for further reading, I will list four factual statements that will be addressed later in the aricle:<BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>Fact #1:</B> One of the tests that the laboratory used has a <i>40% false positive rate!</i> It was little better than flipping a coin.
<LI><B>Fact #2:</B> Drug testing laboratories and organizations have known for well over a decade that eating certain pork products (available in the U.S., but much more 
common outside the U.S.) could trigger a positive test for nandrolone. The fact that eating certain pork products could produce a positive nandrolone test is written 
into drug testing organization guidance documents.
<LI><B>Fact #3:</B> This case does not revolve around whether Shelby Houlihan can prove she ate pork products with nandrolone, but instead revolves around whether the laboratory used the correct 
testing procedures and the correct drug testing organization guidance documents.
<LI><B>Fact #4:</B> There is no set limit on the amount of nandrolone metabolites measured in the urine. Instead, part of the drug testing organization&rsquo;s guidance 
document includes a flowchart showing varying levels of nandrolone metabolites can either cause a drug test fail or a drug test pass depending upon the results of 
additional laboratory tests.

Before going over the details of the case, it is important to understand the organizations involved in the case as well as the case timeline. That information is presented below:<BR>

approved arbitors. One arbitor is chosen by each of the two parties involved in the case. The third arbitor, who leads the team, is then chosen by the two existing arbitors. 
CAS decisions do not have to be unanimous. CAS is often considered the last chance for an appeal in most cases.<BR>
<LI><B><a href="https://www.bger.ch/" target="_blank">Swiss Federal Tribunal</a>:</B> CAS operates under Swiss law. Therefore, a CAS decision can be appealed to 
the Swiss Federal Tribunal. However, in most cases, the Swiss Federal Tribunal will not take a case ruled on by the CAS unless the way the case was handled went against one or more of a 
limited set of public policy issues involving Swiss law. The Swiss Federal Tribunal can rule that some part of the case was not handled appropriately and then send the case 
back to the CAS for re-evaluation.<BR>

<U><B>Case Timeline</B></U>
<UL>
<LI>December 15, 2020. Drug test conducted by AIU on Shelby Houlihan. The urine sample was split into &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; samples.
<LI>January 14, 2021. AIU informed Shelby Houlihan that her &ldquo;A&rdquo; sample had tested positive for nandrolone. She was provisionally suspended.
<LI>January 19, 2021. The lawyer for Shelby Houlihan, Paul Greene, told the AIU that the most likely source of the nandrolone was from ingestion of pork 
in a burrito purchased from a food truck the night before the drug test. He requested that her &ldquo;B&rdquo; sample be tested based on published 
WADA guidelines related to nandrolone from pork consumption.
<LI>January 22-26, 2021. Analysis of the &ldquo;B&rdquo; sample.
<LI>End of January, 2021. &ldquo;B&rdquo; sample analysis results confirm the &ldquo;A&rdquo; sample analysis but there was no documentation given to the Shelby Houlihan&rsquo;s
legal team related to the tests that were requested and required by the WADA guidelines.
<LI>February-April, 2021. Houlihan&rsquo;s team submits additional evidence to the AIU including a hair sample analysis and a polygraph test.
<LI>Late April, 2021. Paul Greene files a case with CAS to force the AIU to charge Shelby Houlihan so that the case could move forward before the 
U.S. Olympic Track & Field Trials in June, 2021.
<LI>Mid May, 2021. The AIU formally charged Shelby Houlihan with a drug violation.
<LI>Late May, 2021. Paul Greene and the AIU agree to a single hearing before CAS rather than an initial hearing by the World Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal in hopes of getting Shelby Houlihan 
exonerated in time for the U.S. Olympic Track & Field Trials in June, 2021.
<LI>June 1, 2021. CAS arbitration hearing held.
<LI>June 11, 2021. CAS ruled against Shelby Houlihan.
<LI>June 14, 2021. Shelby Houlihan's team announced decision of the CAS arbitors at a press conference.

Nandrolone can be found in high levels in uncastrated male pigs ("boars"). In 2008, 
<a href="https://sci-hub.do/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039128X08002481" target="_blank">research</a> was published showing that high concentrations 
of 19-NA can be found in the urine of subjects eating pork meat and organs from uncastrated pigs. Shelby Houlihan had an 19-NA concentration of approximately 5ng/mL (see 5:15 into 
the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jtMMxBPxGg&t=5m15s" target="_blank">Shelby Houlihan Press Conference</a>). This 2008 
<a href="https://sci-hub.do/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039128X08002481" target="_blank">research</a> showed in Table 2 that ingesting 300 grams 
(10.6 ounces) of uncastrated pig organ meat could lead to as much as 130ng/mL of 19-NA in the urine: more than <i><b>25 times</b></i> higher than the 5ng/mL found for Shelby Houlihan. To
be fair, however, there is often approximately 4 ounces of meat in a burrito (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chipotle-portion-size-accuracy-2015-7" target="_blank">Ex. 1</a>, 
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/food/1996/07/24/building-a-burrito-for-a-crowd/2bf80667-f71e-4f92-8f4d-28c4021f9390/" target="_blank">Ex. 2</a>). This 
would still be equivalent to 49ng/mL of 19-NA in urine or nearly <i><b>10 times</b></i> higher than the 5ng/mL found for Shelby Houlihan.<BR>
<BR>
There are three very important points that should be considered when looking at Table 2 of this research:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>This <a href="https://sci-hub.do/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039128X08002481" target="_blank">research</a>
discussed directly above is <i>the</i> research that WADA cites (at the end of Section 3.2.1) in their 
<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/td2021na_final_eng_1.pdf" target="_blank">April 2021</a> 
and <a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/td2021na_final_eng_v2.0_m.pdf" target="_blank">June 2021</a> WADA Technical Documents on Nandrolone. 
They reference high levels of 19-NA found in urine after ingestion of uncastrated pig meat. There are other research papers showing
high levels of 19-NA in the urine after ingestion of pork products (
<a href="https://in.booksc.eu/book/166671/d34662" target="_blank">Ex. 1</a>, 
<a href="https://www.doping.nl/media/kb/7048/H%C3%BClsemann%20et%20al%202020.pdf" target="_blank">Ex. 2</a>), but this research paper is the one that WADA lists in 
their Technical Document.<BR> 

<LI>Look again at <a href="https://sci-hub.do/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039128X08002481" target="_blank">Table 2</a>
and you will see that the measurements only looked at three (3) people for 300g (10.6 ounces) of meat. Also, notice the huge variation of the 
19-NA concentrations for each individual when ingesting 300g (21.4ng/mL - 130ng/mL). It is likely that in a much larger experiment, looking at 1,000 individuals for example, that some 
individual 19-NA concentrations would be higher than the maximum of 130ng/mL listed in Table 2.

<LI>In <a href="https://sci-hub.do/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039128X08002481" target="_blank">Table 2</a>, there are measurements of 19-NA levels in urine
after ingesting uncastrated pig <i>meat</i> (not the organs). You can see that it is not only the organ meat ingestion that can lead to reliatvely high levels of 19-NA measured in 
the urine and potentially cause a drug test fail.

<BR>
<U><B>Did Shelby Houlihan Ingest Pork Products With a High Level of Nandrolone?</B></U><BR>
<BR>
The answer is that it really <i>does not</i> matter if Shelby Houlihan can prove she ate pork with high levels of nandrolone. WADA changed their nandroline guidelines 
in April, 2021 indicating that a different type of analysis needs to be performed should an athlete <i>claim</i> that the nandrolone came from pork ingestion. This 
will be discussed in the next section. In the interest of thoroughness, a few issues related to the possibility of obtaining a burrito with nandrolone in the pork 
will be detailed below:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Shelby Houlihan stopped at a Mexican food truck the night before her drug test and ordered a carne asada burrito but she said 
<a href="https://www.womensrunning.com/culture/news/is-nandrolone-found-in-pork-shelby-houlihan-burrito-questions-answered/" target="_blank">she was mistakenly given a burrito that 
was greasier and had pig organs</a> (&ldquo;pig offal&rdquo;). It appears she bought the burrito to take home and eat while 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HccqofUCqSc" target="_blank">watching The Bachelorette</a> with friends.<BR> 

<LI>Three food Mexican food trucks near Shelby Houlihan's home in Beaverton, Oregon were 
<a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2021/07/07/shelby-houlihan-says-a-burrito-ended-her-olympic-career-we-set-out-to-find-it/" target="_blank">visited recently by a reporter</a> 
and all three of them offered food with pig offal.
<LI>In Europe, meat from uncastrated male pigs is commercially available in all countries except for Norway according to Section 5.1 of the European Commission document, 
<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/system/files/2019-03/aw_prac_farm_pigs_cast-alt_establishing-best-practices.pdf" target="_blank">Establishing best practices on the 
production, the processing and the marketing of meat from uncastrated pigs or pigs vaccinated against boar taint (immunocastrated)</a>. More than 10% of males 
pigs in France go <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210606-deadline-looms-for-french-pig-farmers-on-castration-choice" target="_blank">uncastrated</a>. In 
Kenya, 49% of small farms 
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226461362_Characteristics_of_the_smallholder_free-range_pig_production_system_in_western_Kenya" target="_blank">do do not 
practice pig castration</a>. Paul Greene stated in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jtMMxBPxGg&t=4m42s" target="_blank">press conference</a> that about 2% of the pork in the United States 
comes from uncastrated male pigs. I cannot find any recent data within the last two years showing the percentage of pork in the United States sourced from uncastrated 
male pigs. However, there an FDA-approved drug called <a href="https://www.zoetisus.com/products/pork/improvest/index.aspx" target="_blank">Improvest</a> 
(<a href="https://www.zoetisus.com/improvest/docs/Fact_Sheet_HISTORY.pdf" target="_blank">Improvac</a> outside of the U.S.) that can be used to treat male pigs without 
physical castration.<BR>

<LI>Remember <a href="https://sci-hub.do/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039128X08002481" target="_blank">Table 2</a> from the section above. One 
test subject had 130ng/mL of 19-NA in their urine after ingesting 300g (10.6 ounces) of pig organs. If they had ingested just 11.5g (0.4 ounces) of pig offal, they would 
have had a similar level of 19-NA as did Shelby Houlihan, 5ng/mL. Therefore, the Mexican food truck could have accidently included a small amount of pig offal in the order 
to cause the drug test results.

This section and the previous section of the article proves <B>Fact #2</B> from the article Introduction: 
&ldquo;Drug testing laboratories and organizations have known for well over a decade that eating certain pork products (available in the U.S., but much more common outside 
the U.S.) could trigger a positive test for nandrolone. The fact that eating certain pork products could produce a positive nandrolone test is written into 
drug testing organization guidance documents.&rdquo;<BR>

<LI><B>19-NE:</B> Also known as 19-noretiocholanolone. A metabolite of nandrolone that appears in the urine after taking nandrolone. This chemical is only considered by 
drug testers if certain criteria are met when they screen for nandrolone. More on this chemical later in this article.<BR>
<LI><B>Norethisterone:</B> Norethisterone is found in some oral contraceptive products for females. <b>19-NA</b> is a

<BR>
<U><B>Fours Reasons That Shelby Houlihan Would Not Dope With Nandrolone</B></U><BR>
<BR>
Before following the red line on the flowchart showing the testing of Shelby Houlihan's urine samples, it is important to look at the four reasons that it makes no sense
for Shelby Houlihan to have deliberately taken nandrolone:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Look at the blue box I created in the full flowchart (above) and notice how there is a test for both norethisterone and pregnancy. Norethisterone is found
in certain oral contraceptive products. As mentioned above, <b>19-NA</b> is a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19010339/" target="_blank">metabolite of norethisterone</a>.
You can see in the flowchart above and Section 3.3.1 of the 
<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/td2021na_final_eng_1.pdf" target="_blank">April 1, 2021 WADA Technical Document</a>
that if a young woman is taking an oral contraceptive product and tests show that there is a reasonable
level of the norethisterone metabolite, THNE, in the urine, the athlete can only produce a Negative Finding or an Atypical Finding (ATF). Any young woman who 
wants to deliberately take small amounts of nandrolone would also take an oral contraceptive with norethisterone to guarantee that they would not have an 
Adverse Analytical Finding (AAF) for nandrolone. Shelby Houlihan was not taking an oral contraceptive with norethisterone and therefore would either be  
an ignorant sports doper or, much more likely, she inadvertently ingested a small amount of nandrolone from another source such as pig offal.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>In order for nandrolone to get into the body in sufficient quanity to have a medicinal or performance-enhancing effect, it is 
<a href="https://www.drugs.com/pro/nandrolone.html" target="_blank">injected</a> into the muscles. When taken orally, it is broken
down quickly by the liver and excreted as the metabolites, 19-NA and 19-NE. Oral supplementation of nandrolone or 
<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/schanzer_conversion_2002_completed.pdf" target="_blank">nandrolone 
precursors</a> such as 19-norandrostenedione has been shown to be <i><b>ineffective</b></i> at improving athletic performance 
(<a href="http://www.humankinetics.com/AcuCustom/Sitename/Documents/DocumentItem/188.pdf" target="_blank">Ex. 1</a>, 
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11126609_Effects_of_norandrostenedione_and_norandrostenediol_in_resistance-_trained_men" target="_blank">Ex. 2</a>). The 
reason why oral ingestion of nandrolone or nandrolone precursors is ineffective as medicine or doping is explained in 
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657496/pdf/i25.pdf" target="_blank">Significance of 19‐norandrosterone in athletes' urine samples</a>: 
&ldquo;When orally administered, due to extensive first pass metabolism, the metabolites are rapidly and massively excreted in the initial hours following administration.&rdquo; 
Figures 1 and 2 of the following <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3289/9ef7c91b1bb6bce2f3c488b4c493eea621e5.pdf" target="_blank">research paper</a> show how quickly
the 19-NA concentration in the urine spikes and then returns to near zero (within 12 hours) after orally ingesting a nandrolone precursor. The nandrolone is quickly broken down
by the liver to the 19-NA and 19-NE metabolites and then rapidly excreted.<BR>
<BR>
The problem with <i>injecting</i> nandrolone for doping purposes is that the concentration of 19-NA in the urine spikes to extremely high levels and <i>stays</i> at high levels or weeks 
and sometimes many months. In this 
<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Pharmacokinetic-evaluation-of-three-different-doses-Bagchus-Smeets/a1126e3381017a3ccc8fd353f44bb334c16b8925" target="_blank">research 
paper</a> (click on &ldquo;pdf&rdquo;), in Table 4 (left-most Geometric Mean column) and in Figure 2, you can see that the single injection of nandrolone creates a high concentration 
of 19-NA in the urine for weeks (in the case of <i>one</i> 50mg injection) and months (in the case of <i>one</i> 150mg injection). This 
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293015885_Atypical_excretion_profile_and_GCCIRMS_findings_may_last_for_nine_months_after_a_single_dose_of_nandrolone_decanoate" target="_blank">research 
paper</a> (click on &ldquo;Download PDF&rdquo;) shows in the middle of Figure 1 and espeically in Table 2 that the concentration of 19-NA in the urine can remain high for months after a 
single injection of nandrolone.<BR>
<BR>
Looking at the <a href="https://www.usada.org/news/athlete-test-history/">USADA test history database</a>, Shelby Houlihan had four drug tests in the 4th 
quarter of 2020 and three drug tests in the 1st quarter of 2021. She would have to be an amazingly ignorant doper to inject nandrolone since it can easily
be detected as the 19-NA metabolite in the urine for months or to ingest a nandrolone supplement since it is ineffective and quickly eliminated from 
the body. The much more likely scenario is that she inadvertently ingested a small amount of nandrolone from another source such as pig offal.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>As a prominent athlete, Shelby Houlihan is required to provide a 60-minute window every single day where a drug tester can come to her location and collect urine 
samples. See the FAQ #4 in the <a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/athlete_central_faq_final_en_0.pdf" target="_blank">Athlete Central: 
Frequently Asked Questions</a>. Since plans can change, WADA allows athletes to update their &ldquo;Whereabouts&rdquo; and their 60-minute window in the 
<a href="http://adams-docs.wada-ama.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4392252" target="_blank">ADAMS database</a>. If Shelby Houlihan was doping with an ineffective 
oral nandrolone supplement and was ignorant about taking an oral contraceptive with norethisterone to guarantee passing a drug test, she still could have taken 
oral nandrolone on the night of December 14th and moved her 60-minute window from 6am on December 15th to 11pm on December 15th to guarantee passing the drug test 
as the 19-NA would have been eliminated from her urine by then. The much more likely scenario is that she inadvertently ingested a small amount of nandrolone from another 
source such as pig offal.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>It would be medically reckless for Shelby Houlihan to take nadrolone regularly. Numerous articles have been written that Shelby Houlihan has a hereditary condition 
known as hereditary spherocytosis. As a child she had to have both her spleen and gallbladder removed. This article is <i>not</i> divulging any confidental medical information as 
these facts have been written about and available online for many years 
(<a href="https://www.womensrunning.com/culture/people/you-dont-know-shelby-houlihan/" target="_blank">Ex. 1</a>, 
<a href="https://www.espn.com/blog/endurance/post/_/id/1927/five-questions-how-shelby-houlihan-overcomes" target="_blank">Ex. 2</a>).  
One of the possible hazards of spherocytosis can be a unhealthy increase in the levels of bilirubin in the body leading to a condition known as jaundice. See 
the section labeled, &ldquo;Laboratory Diagnosis&rdquo; on page 810 of <a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/archdischild/89/9/809.full.pdf" target="_blank">this article</a> and 
the section labeled, &ldquo;Jaundice&rdquo; on this <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Hereditary-Spherocytosis-Related-Disorders.aspx" target="_blank">informational 
web page</a>.<BR>
<BR>
Anytime from shortly after gallbladder removal to decades after such an operation, a condition can develop called Post-cholecystectomy syndrome (PCS). From this  
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919109001538" target="_blank">research paper</a>: &ldquo;The incidence of postcholecystectomy syndrome 
has been reported to be as high as 40% in one study, and the onset of symptoms may range from 2 days to 25 years&rdquo;. PCS can lead to an increase in bilirubin and 
jaundice in some cases. Nandrolone can, in some cases, also significantly increase bilirubin in the body. See the Discussion section of 
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304004591_Chronic_High_Doses_of_Nandrolone_Decanoate_on_Blood_Cell_Lipoprotein_Profile_and_Liver_Enzymes_in_Male_Rats" target="_blank">this 
research paper</a> (Click on &ldquo;Download full-text PDF&rdquo;). Two of the <a href="https://bionichepharma.eu/product/deca-med-300-mg-ml/" target="_blank">contraindications</a> 
of taking nandrolone is &ldquo;jaundice&rdquo; and &ldquo;impaired bilirubin excretion with liver disease.&rdquo; It would be medically reckless to take nandrolone as it 
can lead to bilirubin increase and jaundice at the same time that hereditary spherocytosis and potential PCS from gallbladder removal would tend towards the same outcome.<BR>

<U><B>The Red Line (in the flowchart)</B></U><BR>
<BR>
As we follow the red line down the flowchart, we get to the key section where there is controversy regarding the laboratory testing of Shelby Houlihan's urine sample. Below is 
a clipping of that part of the flowchart:<BR>
<BR>
<a href="Flowchart-line3.png" target="_blank"><img src="Flowchart-line3.png"></a><BR>
<BR>
The three boxes (in the partial image of the flowchart directly above) with the urine 19-NA concentration largely determines what direction one goes in the flowchart:
<UL>
<LI>If the concentration of 19-NA in the urine is > 15ng/mL, then it is an automatic AAF (drug test fail) (red circle near the top right).<BR>
<BR>
<LI>If the concentration of 19-NA in the urine is < 2.5ng/mL, then it is a likely a Negative Finding (green circle near the top left), but there is that dotted line from 
the &ldquo;19-NA < 2.5ng/mL&rdquo; box to the GC/C/IRMS box. In order to understand what that means, we must go to the <i>official rules of testing</i> which is laid 
out in the <i>text</i> of the document. The flowchart is just a general guide. In the first bracketed comment on Page 3 of the 
<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/td2021na_final_eng_1.pdf" target="_blank">April 1, 2021 WADA Technical Document</a> on nandrolone (TD2021NA)
we learn that GC/C/IRMS <i>&ldquo;may</i> be performed at concentrations below 2.5 ng/mL, depending on the Laboratory’s
analytical capacity.&rdquo;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>If the concentration of 19-NA in the urine is between 2.5ng/mL and 15ng/mL, and Shelby Houlihan&rsquo;s samples had a concentration of approximately 5ng/mL, then it appears from the 
flowchart that we would use the GC/C/IRMS test to determine if the 19-NA is of endogenous or exogenous origin. However, the flowchart is just a general guide and 
the <i>official rules</i> are spelled out in the <i>text</i> of the document. In 2021, at the end of section 3.2.1,  
<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/td2021na_summaryofmodifications_en_0.pdf" target="_blank">WADA added</a> 
&ldquo;Guidance to discriminate between oral consumption of natural sources of 19-NA and injection of norsteroid preparations based on the pharmacokinetics of 19-NA excretion.&rdquo;
At the end of Section 3.2.1 of the  
<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/td2021na_final_eng_1.pdf" target="_blank">April 1, 2021 WADA Technical Document</a> on nandrolone (TD2021NA), 
WADA states that if the athlete <i><b>invokes</b></i> that edible parts of intact pigs is the source of the nandrolone, then an entirely different
test needs to be performed and not the GC/C/IRMS test as that test may be inaccurate in this case:<BR>

<p class="tabl">
<i>&ldquo;Following consumption of the edible parts of non-castrated male pigs, concentrations of excreted
19-NA in urine are usually in the low ng/mL range (< 10 ng/mL), although higher concentrations
have been exceptionally reported [3]. The origin of the urinary 19-NA may not be established by
GC/C/IRMS analysis, since the varying diets of migrating wild boars lead to dissimilar δ<sup>13</sup>C values
which may range between -15 ‰ and -25 ‰ [9]. Therefore, if the consumption of edible parts of
intact pigs is invoked by an Athlete as the unlikely origin of a 19-NA finding, this may be established
based on the pharmacokinetics of 19-NA excretion [3, 5, 16-18]. Profiles of 19-NA and 19-NE excretion
following oral ingestion will have a different time course than following an injection of 19-
norsteroids.&rdquo;</i></p>
</UL>
<U>Definitions</U>
<UL>
<LI><B>Pharmacokinetics of 19-NA excretion:</B> The measurement of 19-NA excretion from the body over time. This testing can be done by analyzing the 
previous and subsequent urine drug tests that measured the concentration of 19-NA.<BR>
</UL>

Notice how the quoted text above is specific that the endogenous or exogenous &ldquo;origin of the urinary 19-NA <i>may not be established by
GC/C/IRMS analysis</i>.&rdquo; The text then goes on to lay out in some complex scientific detail why the GC/C/IRMS test may be 
inaccurate in this case. Instead, the text of the WADA document recommends that the laboratory use the &ldquo;pharmacokinetics of 19-NA
excretion&rdquo; to determine the origin of the 19-NA found in the urine. As stated in the WADA document, if the nandrolone
is injected, the 19-NA excretion has a different time course (i.e., rate of excretion) than if the nandrolone is ingested (from pork for example). 
Injected nandrolone bypasses the liver, stays in the body for months and high levels of 19-NA can be seen in the urine for months. Therefore, 
the key for Shelby Houlihan should have been to look at the levels of 19-NA in drug testing samples prior to and after the test on December 15, 2021. 
Looking at the <a href="https://www.usada.org/news/athlete-test-history/">USADA test history database</a>, Shelby Houlihan had four drug tests in the 4th 
quarter of 2020 and three drug tests in the 1st quarter of 2021. That is a sufficient number of drug tests to see if there were other results showing a 
high concentration of 19-NA in the urine, indicating possible injections of nandrolone.<BR>
<BR>
Again, looking back at the flowchart, the key is how to determine if the measured 19-NA is of endogenous or exogenous origin. If it is of endogenous 
origin, then the flowchart branches to the left and the results are either a Negative Finding or Atypical Finding (ATF) depending on the ratio of 
19-NA to 19-NE found in the urine. If it is of exogenous origin, then 
the results indicate a drug test fail otherwise known as an Adverse Analytical Finding (AAF). It would seem inappropriate for a laboratory to use the 
GC/C/IRMS test in this case where the WADA document states that the GC/C/IRMS may be inaccurate and the document provides one appropriate testing alternative 
(pharmacokinetics of 19-NA excretion). The Houlihan legal team never received any information from the lab about pharmacokinetics of 19-NA excretion and 
therefore the laboratory may not have looked at it. The green line and arrow in the partial flowchart below shows what should have happened based on the <i>text</i> in the 
<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/td2021na_final_eng_1.pdf" target="_blank">April 1, 2021 WADA Technical Document</a> on nandrolone (TD2021NA).<BR>

<BR>
This section and the previous section of the article prove <B>Fact #3</B> and <B>Fact #4</B> from the article Introduction: 
&ldquo;This case does not revolve around whether Shelby Houlihan can prove she ate pork products with nandrolone, but instead revolves around 
whether the laboratory used the correct testing procedures and the correct drug testing organization guidance documents.&rdquo; <i>and</i> 
&ldquo;There is no set limit on the amount of nandrolone metabolites measured in the urine. Instead, part of the drug testing organization&rsquo;s guidance document 
includes a flowchart showing varying levels of nandrolone metabolites can either cause a drug test fail or a drug test pass depending upon the results of 
additional laboratory tests.&rdquo;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<U><B>The 40% False Positive GC/C/IRMS Test</B></U><BR>
<BR>
There is no question that once the Houlihan legal team <i>invoked</i> the WADA clause on January 19, 2021 that the nandrolone came from pork consumption, the GC/C/IRMS test should
not have been performed on the B sample. Instead, the analysis should have focused on the &ldquo;pharmacokinetics of 19-NA excretion.&rdquo;<BR>
<BR>
<U>GC/C/IRMS Test</U><BR>
The GC/C/IRMS test is one way that the laboratory can determine if the 19-NA found in the urine is from endogenous or exogenous origin. As you can see from the flowchart above, if 
the 19-NA is of endogenous origin, the flowchart branches to the left and there cannot be a drug test fail, only a Negative Finding or an Atypical Finding. The GC/C/IRMS test compares the 
amount of the Carbon-13 isotope to the Carbon-12 isotope found in 19-NA. The isotope ratio tends to be different for naturally-occurring nandrolone in the body or in pork as compared 
to nandrolone manufactured from plant products. The results of the test is expressed as &ldquo;Delta Carbon-13&rdquo; using the symbol:  δ<sup>13</sup>C. The units of measurement 
is expressed in &ldquo;parts per thousand&rdquo; using the symbol: ‰. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jtMMxBPxGg&t=4m43s" target="_blank">press conference</a>, 
Paul Greene stated that GC/C/IRMS test for Shelby Houlihan showed a δ<sup>13</sup>C = -23‰.<BR>
<BR>
There are several research papers showing that endogenous 19-NA from nandrolone tends to have δ<sup>13</sup>C values between -16‰ and -26‰, while exogenous 19-NA 
from injected nandrolone (and most oral supplements) tends to have δ<sup>13</sup>C values between -27‰ and -34‰. In Table 2 of this  
<a href="https://www.academia.edu/25492931/A_simplified_procedure_for_GC_C_IRMS_analysis_of_underivatized_19-norandrosterone_in_urine_following_HPLC_purification" target="_blank">research 
paper</a> (click on &ldquo;Download PDF&rdquo;), the authors show that administration of various synthetic nandrolone products produced a δ<sup>13</sup>C values between -26.3‰ and -30.9‰. 
Figure 5 of this <a href="https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/service/iso_gas_lab/gasir2005/presentations/posters/MHebestreit_ASI_2004.pdf" target="_blank">research paper</a> shows the clear 
difference in δ<sup>13</sup>C values between endogenous 19-NA (-19‰ to -25‰) and exogenous 19-NA (-27‰ to -31‰). In Table 1 of the following 
<a href="https://www.dshs-koeln.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Institute/Biochemie/PDF/Proceedings/Proceedings_22/p133-136_poster_27_delatorre.pdf" target="_blank">research</a> presented at
the 32nd Manfred Donike Workshop on Doping Analysis, shows δ<sup>13</sup>C values at -24.2‰ to -25‰ as a drug test pass.<BR>
<BR>
<U>Changing the GC/C/IRMS Results Interpretation</U><BR>
In the <a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/wada_td2015na_harmonization_analysis_reporting_19-norsteroids_en.pdf" target="_blank">2015 WADA Technical Document</a> 
on nandrolone (TD2015NA), at the bottom of page 2, there were three criteria that had to be met for the GC/C/IRMS test to find the 19-NA as exogenous and a drug test fail:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>The δ<sup>13</sup>C values of 19-NA had to be outside the normal endogenous range of -16‰ to -26‰. In other words, it had to be -27‰ to -34‰ (or lower).
<LI>The difference in the δ<sup>13</sup>C value of 19-NA and the δ<sup>13</sup>C value of an &ldquo;Endogenous Reference Compound (ERC) such as pregnanediol or 
androsterone measured in the urine sample could not be greater than 3‰. The idea behind this test is that if the 19-NA is endogenous, the δ<sup>13</sup>C value of 19-NA 
should not differ much from the δ<sup>13</sup>C value of other steroids in the urine sample.
<LI>The laboratory measurement for the total level of <i>&ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo;</i> of both of the δ<sup>13</sup>C value tests for 19-NA and the endogenous reference compound 
should not be greater than 1‰.
</OL>
By 2014, WADA had a concern that some oral supplements might contain nandrolone precursors that would have δ<sup>13</sup>C values in the endogenous range of -16‰ to -26‰. 
A <a href="" target="_blank">research paper</a> presented at the 32nd Manfred Donike Workshop on Doping Analysis concluded:<BR>
<p class="tabl">
<i>&ldquo;In order to keep the validity of the IRMS confirmation analysis, a continuous survey of the delta values of potential nandrolone precursors present in the market is needed. 
Based on the current data, a revision of the current criteria to release an AAF [failed doping test] for 19-NA is advisable considering what has been suggested for the detection of 
synthetic forms of endogenous anabolic androgenic steroids by IRMS (i.e., testosterone or its precursors), in the new WADA technical document, with the inclusion of the inconclusive
cases when not all criteria are met.&rdquo;</i></p>

Even though the ingestion of nandrolone precursors has not been shown to have any beneficial doping effect and that the nandrolone is eliminated very quickly from the body, WADA 
decided to change their <a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/td2016na_eng.pdf" target="_blank">2016 WADA Technical Document on Nandrolone</a>.
They completely eliminated the requirement that the δ<sup>13</sup>C value of 19-NA had to be -27‰ to -34‰ to prove exogenous origin and a doping test fail (AAF). Instead, the 
decided to rely only on the difference between the δ<sup>13</sup>C value of 19-NA and that of the Endogenous Reference Compound to be > 3‰ to prove exogenous origin and 
a doping test fail (AAF). See the bottom of page 3. It is true that by 2018, one 
<a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/116913981/IRMS_delta_values_13C_BRAILSFORD_Accepted16October2018Publishedonline31October2018_GREEN_AAM.pdf" target="_blank">research paper</a> 
showed that four of nine oral nandrolone precursor supplements on the market in the United Kingdom were created using different plant material and had δ<sup>13</sup>C values in the 
endogenous range. See <a href="https://www.x-mol.com/paper/876732" target="_blank">Table 1</a> from the research paper.<BR>
<BR>
<B>WADA eliminated one of the main parts of the GC/C/IRMS results analysis that protected athletes from false positive results, namely the requirement that the δ<sup>13</sup>C value of 
19-NA had to be -27‰ to -34‰ (or lower) to prove exogenous origin and a doping test fail (AAF)!</B>
<BR>
<BR>
In 2020, <a href="https://www.doping.nl/media/kb/7048/H%C3%BClsemann%20et%20al%202020.pdf" target="_blank">research was published</a> looking at subjects who ate uncastrated pig 
meat (not organs). The researchers measured the urinary δ<sup>13</sup>C values of both 19-NA and an Endogenous Reference Compound (ERC) to determine if the difference 
would be greater than 3‰. According to the WADA Technical Documents since 2016, a value of greater than 3‰ would be judged as &ldquo;exogenous&rdquo; and a drug test fail. You can 
see in Table 1 (last column) that 2 out of the 5 subjects (40%) had a difference of greater than 3‰! <B>Therefore, from this research 40% of the time the GC/C/IRMS test is run when an 
athlete eats uncastrated pig meat or organs, the test would generate a <i>false positive</i> and the athlete would be banned for four years!</B> The danger of such a high percentage
of false positives as seen in this research is exactly why WADA created their new  
<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/td2021na_final_eng_1.pdf" target="_blank">April 1, 2021 WADA Technical Document</a> and provided
guidance at the end of Section 3.2.1 to <i>not</i> use the GC/C/IRMS test if the athlete claims the nandrolone is from pork ingestion, but instead to analyze the pharmacokinetics 
of 19-NA excretion. It appears that the laboratory and the AIU ignored this guidance.<BR> 
<BR>
This section and the previous section of the article proves <B>Fact #1</B> from the article Introduction: 
&ldquo;One of the tests that the laboratory used has a <i>40% false positive rate!</i> It was little better than flipping a coin.&rdquo;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<U><B>The Lab Director</B></U><BR>
<BR>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jtMMxBPxGg&t=4m25s" target="_blank">According to Paul Greene</a>, 
the WADA Laboratory that conducted the test on Shelby Houlihan&rsquo;s samples is in Montreal, Canada and is directed by Dr. Christiane Ayotte.
It seems strange that the samples were sent 3,000 miles across an international border from Beaverton, Oregon to Montreal, Canada when there are other approved WADA Laboratories 
<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do/science-medical/laboratories/accredited-laboratories#region-americas" target="_blank">much closer</a> in 
Salt Lake City, Utah and Los Angeles, California. The athlete, Jarrion Lawson had a drug test performed by AIU in 2018 and the samples were sent to the Los Angeles WADA Laboratory. See
<a href="https://www.athleticsintegrity.org/downloads/pdfs/disciplinary-process/en/CAS_2019_A_6313-Lawson-v.-IAAF_FINAL-AWARD.pdf" target="_blank">Sections II(A)(5) and II(A)(7)</a>.
There very well may be a good reason the samples were sent to the Montreal WADA Laboratory. At some point in the future, maybe the reason will become clear.<BR>
<BR>
The Director of the WADA Laboratory Director in Montreal, Dr. Christiane Ayotte, may have been less than honest in her testimony in the Jarrion Lawson case. What follows is part of 
a summary from the Section VIII(B)(62-63)(Page 12) of the 
<a href="https://www.athleticsintegrity.org/downloads/pdfs/disciplinary-process/en/CAS_2019_A_6313-Lawson-v.-IAAF_FINAL-AWARD.pdf" target="_blank">CAS decision</a>: 
<p class="tabl">
<i>&ldquo;Nor was the Panel entirely persuaded by Professor Ayotte&rsquo;s evidence. Before the Tribunal below, she testified that Trenbolone and metabolite levels measured 
in her laboratory were always low and therefore intentional cheaters could not be separated from athletes measured at levels of picograms consistent with food 
contaminated by hormones.&rdquo;<BR>
<BR>
She said that athletes with high levels were rarely seen after the 1990s. But in fact, her lab records showed that some levels measured were large and that the Athlete&rsquo;s 
level was below 18 out of 21 reported since 2013. Moreover, the data she produced for this appeal showed that, indeed, many urine samples in 2018/19 for athletes in America
(where Tenbolone is legal as a muscle promoter in cattle) were positive for Trenbolone metabolites at low levels (of less than 2ng/mL).&rdquo;</i></p>

Was it an oversight that Dr. Ayotte&rsquo;s testimony conflicted with her own laboratory&rsquo;s records or was she misleading the World Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal and the Jarrion Lawson
legal team? The following two WADA Code of Ethics requirements (on pages 119-120) from the 
<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/isl_nov2019.pdf" target="_blank">World Anti-Doping Code International Standard for Laboratories</a> 
<i>may</i> have been violated:
<p class="tabl">
<i>&ldquo;4.1 The personnel of Laboratories and WADA-Approved Laboratories for the ABP shall not engage in conduct or activities that undermine or are detrimental to the 
World Anti-doping Program. Such conduct could include, but is not limited to fraud, embezzlement, perjury, etc. that would cast doubt on the integrity of the anti-doping
program.&rdquo;<BR>
<BR>
4.6 If a staff member of a Laboratory of WADA-Approved for the ABP is requested to provide evidence in anti-doping proceedings, they are expected to provide independent, 
scientifically-valid expert testimony.&rdquo;</p></i>
Section 4.6.4.3 states that the laboratory accreditation can be revoked for &ldquo;A serious or repeated violation(s) of the Code of Ethics.&rdquo;<BR>
<BR>
Had an athlete provided false testimony, they would very likely be banned from the sport for four years or more. In the real world, outside of the doping testing 
organizations, when an expert provides false information, not only are they prevented from being an expert in future cases, but all of their past cases are carefully
reviewed (<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-08-21-mn-29449-story.html" target="_blank">Ex. 1</a>,

inappropriate that this laboratory appears to have made the decision use a flawed GC/C/IRMS test rather than look at the pharmacokinetics of 19-NA excretion as 
suggested in the <a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/td2021na_final_eng_1.pdf" target="_blank">April 1, 2021 WADA Technical 
Document</a> on nandrolone (TD2021NA). The WADA document was published in December, 2020 and not approved until April 1, 2021. However, a re-analysis of the 
pharmacokinetics of 19-NA excretion based on other Shelby Houlihan drug tests could easily have been done by the laboratory and the AIU in April, 2021.<BR>


<BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Appeal Options</B></U><BR>
<BR>
The next step for the Shelby Houlihan team will be to hire a Swiss law firm and appeal to the Swiss Federal Tribunal. Appeals of the CAS arbitration 
panels can be based on <a href="https://globalarbitrationreview.com/guide/the-guide-challenging-and-enforcing-arbitration-awards/2nd-edition/article/switzerland" target="_blank">procedural 
grounds</a>: discovery of decisive new evidence or grounds for challenging the selection of an arbitor, or 
on <a href="https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/1-519-2649?__lrTS=20180129021519789&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true" target="_blank">substantive 
grounds</a>: &ldquo;A decision only violates substantive public policy if it is rendered in disregard of fundamental principles of law and consequently cannot be reconciled 
with the essential and widely recognised system of values which serves as the bedrock for any legal order.&rdquo;<BR>
<BR>
However, an appeal is not necessary should WADA, AIU, World Athletics and the Montreal Laboratory do the right thing to maintain integrity within anti-doping 
and sports organizations:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>WADA should remind that Montreal Laboratory and the AIU that they must comply with the guidance in the WADA Technical Documents and that the 40% false positive 
GC/C/IRMS test should not have been used in this case. They can order a re-evaluation of the case.
<LI>AIU should realize that they are damaging the reputation of anti-doping organizations by ignoring WADA guidance, despite a 2-1 victory at the CAS hearing. They
could reverse the decision as well.
<LI>The WADA Laboratory Director, Dr. Christiane Ayotte, should publically state that under the recent WADA guidance, the GC/C/IRMS test would not be used and should not be used
due to the extremely high false positive rate where pork ingestion is involved. She should call for a re-evaluation of the case based on the pharmacokinetics of 19-NA excretion.
<LI>World Athletics should remind the AIU that drug tests should be conducted and evaulated under the most <i>current</i> WADA guidance.
</UL>
<U>Lex Mitior</U><BR>
The Houlihan team argued at the CAS hearing that the test to determine the endogenous or exogenous origin of the 19-NA in the urine should have involved analyzing 
the pharmacokinetics of 19-NA excretion as laid out in the 
<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/td2021na_final_eng_1.pdf" target="_blank">April 1, 2021 WADA Technical Document</a>. It is clear that the AIU argued 
against this at the CAS hearing. One important issue related to the WADA documents is that at the top of the 
<a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/td2021na_final_eng_1.pdf" target="_blank">April 1, 2021 WADA Technical Document</a> on nandrolone (TD2021NA), 
you can see that it was published on December 21, 2020, but did not go into effect until April 1, 2021. Shelby Houlihan had her drug test on December 15, 2020 before
this document went into effect.<BR>
<BR>
The previous <a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/td2019na_final_eng_clean.pdf" target="_blank">WADA technical document</a> went into effect March 1, 2019. 
This older document made no mention of looking at the pharmacokinectics of 19-NA excretion. The March 1, 2019 WADA document was in effect during the drug 
testing procedure. On the other hand, the April 1, 2021 WADA document was in effect during the CAS hearing. So, which document should be used? It is possible that
the 2 of 3 CAS arbitors who voted against Shelby Houlihan on the issue of testing procedures used the WADA document from March 1, 2019.<BR>
<BR>
However, there is a legal principle called &ldquo;lex mitior&rdquo; which means &ldquo;If the law has changed after an offense was committed, the version of the 
law that applies is the one that is more advantageous for the accused.&rdquo; In this case the rules changed before the June 1, 2021 hearing was held on the Houlihan case. 
In a <a href="https://content.next.westlaw.com/6-502-4347?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&__lrTS=20180917083325258&firstPage=true">
2010 case before the Swiss Federal Tribunal</a> (see 6 paragraphs from the bottom) and that involved the CAS, the Court ruled on the merits of lex mitior. 
While this particular case in front of the Swiss Federal Tribunal ultimately went against the athlete, it appears the Court will consider the principle of lex mitior. 
Houlihan may have a good case since it appears two of the three CAS arbitors may have relied on an old, 2019 WADA technical document at the hearing to decide if the correct 
laboratory testing procedures were followed.<BR>
<BR>
In a completely separate case, the AIU agreed that new WADA Guidance should be followed and can reverse a drug testing ban. See Items 15-16 and 21-22 in the following
<a href="https://www.athleticsintegrity.org/downloads/pdfs/disciplinary-process/en/Nabokau-Summary-reinstatement-decision.pdf" target="_blank">summary</a>.<BR>
<BR>
<U>Disregard for the Fundamental Principles of Law</U><BR>
The use of the GC/C/IRMS test with a 40% false positive rate in cases of uncastrated pork ingestion is abhorrent and <i>disregards of fundamental principles of law</i>. 
If CAS mistakenly relied on this test when deciding if the correct laboratory procedures were followed, the CAS ruling should be reversed and sent back to a new CAS panel with a 
suggestion that the current WADA guidelines should be followed, including the analysis of the pharmacokinetics of 19-NA excretion.<BR>

<H2>Part 2: The Problems of Sports Drug Testing</H2>

<U><B>Introduction</B></U><BR>
<BR>
Many fans of running as a sport think that most elite runners are &ldquo;dopers&rdquo; or &ldquo;cheaters.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a sad state of affairs that
is reminiscent of the Salem Witch Trials from centuries ago. The truth is there are probably some athletes who fail a drug test who are deliberately cheating (e.g., 
<a href="https://www.givemesport.com/1556855-womens-sport-the-rise-and-fall-of-sprint-sensation-marion-jones" target="_blank">Marion Jones</a>
<a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/233129/hellebuyck-admits-to-doping.html" target="_blank">Eddy Hellebuyck</a>), 
some who were inadvertently exposed to banned substances through contamination or other means (e.g., 
<a href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2017/06/19/ajee-wilson-positive-drug-test/" target="_blank">Ajee Wilson</a>, 
<a href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2018/09/27/will-claye-drug-test-clenbuterol/" target="_blank">Will Claye</a>, 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/opinion/brenda-martinez-doping-depression-olympics.html" target="_blank">Brenda Martinez</a>), 
and some who <i>may be</i> completely innocent (e.g., 
<a href="https://www.paralympic.org/news/lifetime-ban-dropped-after-athlete-s-former-partner-admits-sabotage" target="_blank">Gunduz Ismayilov</a>, 
see <a href="#Part1" target="_blank">Part 1</a> of this article above).
Part 2 of this article was not written to denigrate anti-doping organizations or the many wonderful people who work for these organizations, but it was written 
to point out possible problems and suggest possible solutions.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Guilty Until Proven Innocent</B></U><BR>
<BR>
In Sections 10.1 and 10.2 of the 
<a href="https://www.worldathletics.org/download/download?filename=cb8d47d6-8b01-4cae-b5ad-8889563ef4a9.pdf&urlslug=D5.1%20-%20Disciplinary%20Tribunal%20Rules" target="_blank">World 
Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal Rules</a>, the &ldquo;Burden and Standard of Proof&rdquo; is:<BR>
<p class="tabl">
<i>&ldquo;10.1 The [Athletics] Integrity Unit will have the burden of establishing that a Non-Doping Violation
has been committed. The standard of proof will be whether the Integrity Unit has
established the commission of the alleged violation to the comfortable satisfaction of
the Panel. This standard of proof in all cases is greater than a mere balance of
probability but less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.&rdquo;<BR>
<BR>
10.2 Where the Integrity Code of Conduct places the burden of proof upon the Applicable
Person alleged to have committed a violation to rebut a presumption or establish 
specified facts or circumstances, the standard of proof will be by a balance of
probability.&rdquo;</p></i>
At first glance it appears that 10.1 requires the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) to prove beyond the balance of probability that the drug violation occurred, the way it appears to
work is that if there is a laboratory report that claims a doping violation and the AIU brings its case to the World Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal, that is all of the proof it 
needs. The AIU&rsquo; proof is already built in to the laboratory report. On the other hand, the an innocent athlete is assumed guilty and must prove beyond the 
&ldquo;balance of probability&rdquo; their innocence. This also known as their &ldquo;strict liability&ldquo; standard: if a laboratory claims that a doping substance is found in 
your body for any reason, you are guilty unless you can prove otherwise.<BR>
<BR>
There are advantages to a &ldquo;strict liability&ldquo; standard in relation to performance enhancing drugs and sports. We may not be able to remove any dopers from sports 
if the athlete was assumed to be innocent and the anti-doping organizations had to provide other corroberating evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. On the other hand, 
if you can put yourselves in the shoes of an elite athlete for a moment: You are training for hours every day, practicing various recovery and injury prevention routines for 
additional hours every day all for the chance of representing your country and a World Championships or the Olympics. Let&rsquo;s say you are suddenly accused of doping and  
sent a lab report by the AIU. The AIU already has their &ldquo;proof&rdquo;. You, as the athlete (if you are innocent), start with absolutely nothing: No understanding of the lab 
report, no idea why you tested positive and probably no idea where to start to prove your innocence. It&rsquo;s a tremendously unequal relationship between you as the athlete and 
the AIU when it comes to doping charges.<BR>
<BR>
<U>Suggestion</U><BR>
If we are to keep the &ldquo;strict liability&rdquo; standard, my suggestion is that World Athletes and the AIU help organize a small committee made up of sports law experts 
<i>who have had no association with WADA, AIU, CAS or World Athletics</i>, to help guide them away from being little more than an &ldquo;attack dog&rdquo; to more of a partner
in finding the truth (but still aggressive where needed).<BR>
<BR>
<U>Example Case</U><BR>
The following case may not be as clear-cut as the 
<a href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2017/06/19/ajee-wilson-positive-drug-test/" target="_blank">Ajee Wilson</a> or
<a href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2018/09/27/will-claye-drug-test-clenbuterol/" target="_blank">Will Claye</a> 
cases, but it raises several issues that are relevent to this section and subsequent sections of the article. The case involves nandrolone 
and will be much easier to understand if you read <a href="#Part1" target="_blank">Part 1</a> of this article.
It may appear in my initial discussion of the case that I am trying to defend this athlete, but that <i>is not</i> why I am bringing up this case. 
Please read to the end of the discussion.<BR>
<BR>
Gomathi Marimuthu, an 800-meter runner for India was banned in 2019 for failing doping tests for nandrolone. The decision of the World Athletics 
Disciplinary Tribunal can be found

<BR>
The first thing I noticed is that is that there were <i>two</i> tests on April 13, 2019. It seemed strange until I ready through the 
<a href="https://www.athleticsintegrity.org/downloads/pdfs/disciplinary-process/en/200526-World-Athletics-v-Gomathi-Marimuthu-Final.pdf" target=_blank">
decision of the World Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal</a>, particularly Item #102 (and Item #101) where it was explained that the athlete mistakenly filled 
the &ldquo;A&rdquo; sample bottle first and then the &ldquo;B&rdquo; sample bottle. Apparently, the athlete is supposed to fill the &ldquo;B&rdquo; sample bottle 
to a minimum volume of 30mL and then fill the &ldquo;A&rdquo; sample bottle to a minimum volume of 60mL. Because of this error, the athlete provided another
urine sample on the same day.<BR>
<BR>
Far more important is the difference in urine concentration of 19-NA in those samples on the same day, possibly collected within an hour of each other. The 
19-NA concentration went down from 187ng/mL to 16.2ng/mL! If this decrease is even possible in this short amount of time, it would occur from oral ingestion 
of nandrolone or a nandrolone precursor. To see how slowly the 19-NA urine levels descrease over time when nandrolone is <i>injected</i>, look at Figures 2 and 3 of 
<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Pharmacokinetic-evaluation-of-three-different-doses-Bagchus-Smeets/a1126e3381017a3ccc8fd353f44bb334c16b8925" target="_blank">this 
research paper</a> (click on PDF link) and Figure 1 of 
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293015885_Atypical_excretion_profile_and_GCCIRMS_findings_may_last_for_nine_months_after_a_single_dose_of_nandrolone_decanoate" target="_blank">this 
research paper</a> (click on Download full-text PDF). On the other hand, Figures 1 and 2 from 
<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3289/9ef7c91b1bb6bce2f3c488b4c493eea621e5.pdf" target="_blank">this research paper</a> shows how quickly urinary 19-NA can spike 
and return to near zero within 12-24 hours. Therefore, if the urine 19-NA tests are accurate, then it is almost certainly due to an ineffective (for doping purposes) oral 
ingestion of nandrolone or nandrolone precursors. Note: It is also a little strange that the Sample ID # (A6364741) is smaller on the later sample on April 13, 2019 than the 
earlier sample (A6364751). I would expect that the Sample ID #&rsquo;s on the same day would increase.<BR>
<BR>
The is where an anti-doping organization should see this result and say to themselves, <i>&ldquo;Hmm, if we can trust our labs to measure 19-NA correctly, then the nandrolone 
is clearly coming from an ineffective, oral source. If that is the case and this athlete ingested nandrolone or a nandrolone precursor in three competitions in a row, where
they can expect to be tested, she is either the dumbest sports doper in the history of the world or ingested it inadvertently.&rdquo;</i> It is a distinctly different attitude 
than, <i>&ldquo;Convict! Convict! Burn the witch!!!&rdquo;</i><BR>
<BR>
Is it possible that this athlete was taking another undetectable banned substance that happened to also be contaminated with nandrolone. Yes, of course that is <i>possible</i>. 
But just like we can&rsquo;t convict someone of burglery only because they also <i>might have</i> (without any evidence) stolen a car the same day, we can&rsquo;t let something else an
athlete might have done affect a decision about nandrolone. If the anti-doping organization had the first attitude in the paragraph above, it might have led to further investigation
such as the National Anti-Doping Agency of India interviewing the athlete and coach regarding food and supplments taken. It might have led to a lesser ban such as 2 years or it 
might have still ended up as a 4-year ban. But it is the attitude change by the anti-doping organization that is important, in my opinion.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Tribunal Bias</B></U><BR>
<BR>
Reading through the <a href="https://www.athleticsintegrity.org/disciplinary-process/first-instance-decisions" target="_blank">First Instance Decisions</a> of the 
World Athletics Disciplinary Tribunals, I detect a distanct bias towards the AIU and their experts and against the athlete and their experts. It should be pointed out
again that once a WADA Laboratory comes back with a positive test, the AIU has all the evidence it needs to convict and it has experts from other laboratories ready to
testify as their expert witnesses. At the same point in time, the athlete has absolutely nothing: no knowledge of the science, no experts and almost no hope. Therefore, 
I do not consider it a bias towards the athlete to give him/her extensions to put their case together. They are, after all, starting from zero, unlike the AIU.<BR>
<BR>
In the <a href="https://www.athleticsintegrity.org/downloads/pdfs/disciplinary-process/en/200526-World-Athletics-v-Gomathi-Marimuthu-Final.pdf" target=_blank">World  
Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal case</a> for Gomathi Marimuthu mentioned above, in Items #54-56, the Tribunal did not accept the 2nd statement of the athlete's expert 
witness because witness did not sign the statement. The document with signature was due on April 10, 2020. A reminder was sent out on April 17, 2020 and the expert 
witness provided a signature on April 21, 2020. The Tribunal ruled that:<BR>
<p class="tabl">
<i>&ldquo;It is a party&rsquo;s responsibility to prepare the documents it would like to rely on, properly and in time - this was not done by the deadline set, i.e., 
10 April 2020.</p></i>

Two weeks later, the World Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal allowed the AIU to changes (&ldquo;correct&rdquo;) the laboratory Sample ID #&rsquo;s. (See Item #57). In 
Item #23, the Athlete had expressed concern about a <i>&ldquo;manipulation error or switching of the samples.&rdquo;</i> The point is, however, there was no rejection 
of this AIU change with the statement, &ldquo;It is a party&rsquo;s responsibility to prepare the documents it would like to rely on, properly and in time....&rdquo;. 
In Item #119, the Athlete pointed out that the laboratory &ldquo;simulate sequence run log&rdquo; in relation to the first drug test was conducted on May 6, 2019, but 
the signing of the log was not done until June 5, 2019 (nearly one month later). Again, the Tribunal accepted this log instead of rejecting it with a statement similar
to that mentioned above. Whether the 2nd statement of the Athlete&rsquo;s expert would have made a difference in not relevent. What is important is that the Tribunal not show
this sort of bias towards the AIU and against the athlete.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<U><B>The Secret Courts</B></U><BR>
<BR>
The World Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) decisions can <i>&ldquo;never&rdquo;</i> be wrong. How do I know this? Simple. It&rsquo;s because
the decisions, with few exceptions, do not provide even the basic information which would allow an interested 3rd party to review and see if there are any mistakes. While 
that may be very comforting to the arbitors, it makes a mockery of judicial process. The case of 
<a href="https://www.athleticsintegrity.org/downloads/pdfs/disciplinary-process/en/200526-World-Athletics-v-Gomathi-Marimuthu-Final.pdf" target=_blank">Gomathi Marimuthu</a>
mentioned above is an exception where at least a very minimal amount of basic information is provided, but not enough to see if there were mistakes. If you look at the 
<a href="https://www.athleticsintegrity.org/disciplinary-process/first-instance-decisions" target="_blank">First Instance Decisions</a> or
<a href="https://www.athleticsintegrity.org/disciplinary-process/appeal-decisions" target="_blank">Appeal Decisions</a> related to nandrolone (for example), you will almost 
never see any information about the levels of 19-NA in the urine, the δ<sup>13</sup>C values of 19-NA or the Endogenous Reference Compounds, no levels of 19-NE mentioned, 
no levels of GC/C/IRMS uncertainty mentioned, the test for norethisterone metabolites (from oral contraceptives), differentiating between exogenous nandrolone or that 
ingested from pork from uncastrated male pigs. There are no hearing transcripts or video and no exhibits. There are no statements from experts on either side, only the 
panel&rsquo;s interpretation of those experts and a judgement on whom they decide to believe.
